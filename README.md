# oil-vs-earthquake
â€‹I built an application that allows users to visualize the association between oil drilling and earthquakes. Oil production has increased in the past years and the frequency of earthquakes has also increased. The visualization points out the possibility of a relationship between oil drilling and earthquakes. I used PHP, javascript, and the USGA earthquake dataset API. I used PHP to search for and retrieve relevant data from the USGA website. I used javascript to send http requests to pull the data from the PHP file.
