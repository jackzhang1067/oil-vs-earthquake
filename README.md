# oil-vs-earthquake
â€‹I built an application that allows users to visualize the association between oil drilling and earthquakes. Oil production has increased in the past years and the number of earthquakes per year has also increased. The visualization points out the possibility of a relationship between oil drilling and earthquakes.
